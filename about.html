        <h2>Craftsperson and a Builder</h2>
        <p>From ceramics to carpentry to woodworking, crafting useful things
          has always been at the core of my interests. In 2012, I set off on a
          three-year project to build a tiny house. From my time working on boats,
          I was inspired by the deeply considered design solutions that small
          spaces require.</p>
        <p>This project led to pursuing more formal training in woodworking where
          I was first immersed in the ethos of craftsmanship and pre-industrial design
          techniques. I spent a lot of time thinking about how people interact with
          objects, why certain traditional forms are still successful today, and
          learned how to produce work that is intended to outlast my lifetime. I’m
          fascinated by how furniture was historically designed without measurements,
          but instead with ratios based on the human body. It's a beautiful mixture of
          geometry and humanity.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="container-sm">
          <h2>Crew Member</h2>
          <p>I’m passionate about maritime education and using boats as a platform
            for developing community awareness. Working on tall ships, traditional small
            craft, and eco-tourism boats in Puget Sound and SE Alaska has been an invaluable
            gift from my time in the Pacific Northwest. I’m a believer that the sea is a great
            teacher of adaptability, teamwork, and mindfulness. </p>

      <div class="container-sm">
        <h2>Creative Collaborator</h2>
        <p>In my other life, I was a chef in a farm to table kitchen. It was a magical place
          where I had a lot of freedom to be creative and learned to improvise on the fly.
          Our kitchen cultivated an environment where we could trust each other’s creative
          visions while exchanging feedback and producing a unified feel for our menus. While
          being vulnerable with creative work could be daunting, so much growth always came from
          collaboration. From this time, I learned how to quickly iterate on ideas and confidently
          present my vision.  </p>

      <div class="container-sm">
        <h2>Digital Design</h2>
        <p>Four years of working in nonprofit administration threw me into a variety of roles that I
          wouldn’t have otherwise pursued. This is where I first became interested in digital media.
          After being asked to "make a couple updates" to an outdated website, I instead proposed a
          complete redesign. This led to me accidentally staying up until 2 am on a regular basis
          messing with layouts, reorganizing pages, writing new content, and interviewing students.
          Even though I’ve mostly been drawn to working with my hands, I’ve found that the digital
          world is an engaging medium through which I can constantly be exploring new ideas while
          honing my craft and growing through collaboration.  </p>
