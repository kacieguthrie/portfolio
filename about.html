            <h2>Craftsperson and a Builder</h2>
            <p>From ceramics to carpentry to woodworking, crafting useful things
              has always been at the core of my interests. In 2012, I set off on a
              three year project to build a tiny house. From my time working on boats,
              I was inspired by the deeply considered design solutions that small
              spaces require.</p>
            <p>This project led to pursuing more formal training in woodworking where
              I was first immersed in the ethos of craftsmanship and pre-industrial design
              techniques. I spent a lot of time thinking about how people interact with
              objects, why certain traditional forms are still successful today, and
              learned how to produce work that is intended to outlast my lifetime. I’m
              fascinated by how furniture is traditionally designed without measurements,
              but instead with ratios based on the human body. It's a beautiful mixture of
              geometry and humanity.</p>

            <h2>Crew Member</h2>
            <p>I’m passionate about maritime education and using boats as a platform
              for developing community awareness. Working on tall ships, traditional c
              raft, and eco-tourism boats in Puget Sound and SE Alaska has been an invaluable
              gift from my time in the Pacific Northwest. I’m a believer that the sea is a great
              teacher of adaptability, responsibility, and presence of mind. </p>

            <h2>Creative Collaborator</h2>
            <p>In my other life, I was a chef in a farm to table kitchen. It was a magical place
              where I had a lot of freedom to be creative and learned to improvise on the fly.
              Our kitchen cultivated an environment where we could trust each other’s creative
              visions while exchanging feedback and producing a unified feel for our menus. While
              being vulnerable with creative work could be daunting, so much growth came from
              collaboration. From this time, I learned how to quickly iterate on ideas and confidently
              present my vision.  </p>

            <h2>Transition to Digital Design</h2>
            <p>Four years working in nonprofit administration threw me into a variety of roles that I
              wouldn’t have otherwise pursued. This is where I first became interested in digital media.
              After being asked to "make a couple updates" to an outdated website, I instead proposed a
              complete redesign. This led to me accidentally staying up until 2 am on a regular basis
              messing with layouts, reorganizing pages, writing new content, and obsessing over imagery.
              Even though I’ve mostly been drawn to working with my hands, I’ve found that the digital
              world is an engaging medium through which I can constantly be exploring new ideas while
              honing my craft and growing through collaboration.  </p>
