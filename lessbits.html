            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>HostLaunch is an app for managing a webhosting business. It allows businesses to bill customers and manage servers.</p>
            <p>The primary focus had been on the more complex backend functionality. Work on the frontend interface had been minimal.
              Hosting companies were deterred by the setup process and customers were confused about the server subscription model.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Background</h4>
            <p>I came into this project a few months before the alpha launch.
              At this point, a lot of the foundational dev work was in place on
              the backend and the frontend existed as a minimal interface for
              performing basic functions. This is what it looked like.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="container-lg">
          <img src="images/lessbits/early-ui.png" alt="" class="image-responsive">
        </div>
        <div class="project-text container-sm">
          <p> The dev team had done a good job of keeping it very simple, so users
            could stumble through the setup process by mere virtue of the fact that
            there was very little to click on. I call this strategy, “just try clicking on
            the big blue button and see what happens.” It works, but not well.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project-text container-sm">
          <h4>Discovery and Testing</h4>
          <p>To get familiar with the app, I started with a crash course in the
            hosting industry to understand why this app even exists. Then I began an audit of the existing
            interface for UX/UI issues. Through informal user testing, I discovered
            pain points in the interface. I cataloged them in Github issues along with
            tech bugs and customer requests from our support department. It was valuable
            to see them side by side because some of them overlapped or “solved”
            each other and we could begin to see patterns.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project-text container-sm">
          <h4>Challenge: Onboarding</h4>
          <p>The initial set up process for hosting companies required a lot of
            steps including API integrations with 3rd party services. Of the 300+
            users who initially signed up for the alpha version, only 10% completed
            all the setup steps required to get their account out of “maintenance mode”.</p>
          <p>One of the challenges of this was helping hostcos get to the point where they
            were receiving value from the app as soon as possible. The distance from clicking
            “sign up” to earning their first dollar might be an hour or it might be weeks.
            We needed to keep them pointed toward their goal and remind them of the value proposition of the app. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="project-text container-half-lg">
          <div class="">
            <h4>Iterations</h4>
            <p>To get started, I created an initial sketch of what the onboarding process might
              look like. Because there was very little to interact within the
              interface before the setup was complete, I opted for a "wizard-like" design.</p>
            <p>Working with the developer, we defined the technical parameters of what we
              could build in the time we had and then rethought the original onboarding flow.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="">
            <img src="images/lessbits/onboard-sketch.jpg" alt="original sketches" class="image-responsive">
            <h5>Early concept sketch with notes and revisions</h5>
          </div>

        </div>
        <div class="project-text container-sm">
          <h3>Technical Parameters</h3>
          <ul class="bullet">
            <li><p>Try not to recreate existing code. Because of the way the code was structured, it wasn’t easy to reuse code that already existed. Just because a form was in the settings menu, didn’t mean it could be easily recreated for a separate onboarding flow.</p></li>
            <li><p>Don’t block users from skipping any steps. Because we were dealing
              with a number of third-party services, we knew that there were going to be
              times when a user couldn’t enter a piece of data right away due to forces
              outside our own control. They needed to complete all the requirements
              and also needed to skip around to do it.</p></li>
            <li><p>Most requirements can be completed in any order, but a few are sequential.</p></li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="project-text container-sm">
          <h3>Revisions and Testing</h3>
          <p>We revised our process and tested for usability. Because the
            Bootstrap 3 UI was very basic and constrained by space, it was easiest to use real data in a hi-fi mockup.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container-half-lg">
          <img src="images/lessbits/contracted.png" alt="prototype" class="image-responsive">
          <img src="images/lessbits/expanded.png" alt="prototype" class="image-responsive">
        </div>
        <div class="project-text container-sm">
          <h4>Implementation</h4>
          <h3>Tiered Roll-out Plan</h3>
          <p>Because we were working within a short timeframe, I described a few different options for our onboarding process. </p>
          <p>Least time (most essential features) ---> Most time (more ideal features)</p>
          <h3>Supporting Elements</h3>
          <p>Thinking beyond the interface, we also created a welcome email with
            tips for getting your business up and running and a best practices document that addressed some common mistakes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project-text container-sm">
          <h4>Further Challenges</h4>
          <p>We worked on a number of challenges for this project such as:</p>
          <h3>Subscription Model</h3>
          <p>The pricing and subscription model for our app was slightly different
            than what customers may have been used to. Our challenge was to communicate
            as much as possible about subscriptions indirectly through the interface and
            only use supporting text when necessary. We did this through carefully considered user flows.</p>
          <h3>Dashboard Metrics</h3>
          <p>Early version of the dashboard metrics.</p>
          <img src="images/lessbits/early-hl-dashboard.png" alt="dashboard" class="image-responsive">
          <div class="spacer-sm">

          </div>
          <h3>Customer Interface and Onboarding</h3>
          <p>Customers of the hosting companies needed to learn how to set up their first server and website.</p>
          <h3>Branding and Marketing Materials</h3>
          <p>This was my least favorite part of this project, but necessary to take on in a small company.</p>

          <img src="images/lessbits/hl-styles.png" alt="brand and social media" class="image-responsive">
        </div>
        <div class="project-text container-sm">
          <h4>Learnings</h4>
          <h3>Lack of User Data</h3>
          <p>Although most of the work I did on this project was directly related
            to improving the interface, I think we overlooked one of the main challenges of this software.
            We spent most of our time trying to help a hosting company complete
            the technical steps of setting up a hosting company (connecting APIs, managing servers, etc.).
            We didn't spend enough time talking to actual hosting companies about
            their business needs. This, to me, should have been the driving force
            behind some of the features such as creating pricing plans and dashboard metrics.</p>
          <h3>Direct Collaboration</h3>
          <p>The biggest learning on this project was how to make my
            designs work within the technical parameters of the code. It's one
            thing to come up with an idea that will work and another to come up
            with an idea that can be implemented quickly with relatively low effort.
            Working directly with the developer on this was fun and productive.</p>
