            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>What is affecting my mood?
            There are a wide variety of factors that affect our mood, they can be
            psychological, environmental, or biological. Trying to understand which
            factors are affecting us most can be confusing and overwhelming.</p>

            <p>People who seek professional treatment often find it difficult to
            communicate effectively with health providers about the complex factors
            affecting their mood. Mental and physical health are connected, though they are
            often treated separately. How can we help patients tell a better story?

              <p>By broadly tracking aspects of mood, lifestyle, and health habits,
                Moodscape visualizes the data so users can gain insight into the wide
                variety of factors that can affect their mood. The desired outcomes are
                to empower people to see patterns in their behavior, improve self-awareness,
                and have better communication with medical and mental health care professionals.

          <h2>Strategy</h2>
          <p>The approaches to mood tracking and mental health apps were meditation,
            Cognitive Behavior Therapy, coping strategies, creative writing, social/community engagement, etc. </p>

          <p>What approach was I going to use? I wanted to build a tool for communicating,
            organizing, and reflecting on the factors that influence our moods.
            I chose to build a data-centered approach to health management.</p>
          <h3>Why use a data centered approach?</h3>
            <ul class="bullet">
              <li><p>Tracking data helps us learn something we can’t understand
                intuitively by organizing the information and giving it perspective. </p></li>
              <li><p>The act of self-reporting a piece of information helps us to
                become more aware of it and reflect on it.</p></li>
              <li><p>The ability to compare multiple factors helps us assess their relationship to each other.</p></li>
              <li><p>Tracking our metrics on a goal that takes time to see change
                or results can help us feel more engaged/motivated. </p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>In developing this strategy, I used my design journal practice to think through the research.
              Read more about the questions I asked to define the problem and focus on a strategy:</p>
            <ul class="bullet">
              <li><p>What are some of the risks of this approach?</p></li>
              <li><p>What are some other ways I could approach this task?</p></li>
              <li><p>What personal bias am I bringing to the project?</p></li>

            <p>I chose a soft friendly triangle to hold it and a round

                <p>The user flows and sketches were the real work-horse of this
                  process where I made the most changes.
                  Whenever possible, I like to start out working in analog because it feels less precious
                  and I'm more likely to explore a lot of ideas.</p>

<!-- Conclusion   -->

        <div class="section-header" id="Conclusion">
          <h2>What I learned</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="container-sm">
          <p>This project walks the line between the very human side of mental health and the very computer side of data collection.
            On one side, I learned how difficult it can be to get a perspective on your own mental state and that the barriers are mostly our own.
            On the other hand, I learned how to ask for data in a way that makes it useful in a visualization.</p>
          <h2>Next Steps</h2>
          <p>Because of the limited time-frame and a team of one, I didn't get to work on everything I wanted to do.
              I've been considering which features I would work on next to make a better experience:</p>
          <ul>
            <h3>Layout for Export</h3>
            <li><p>An easy to read layout or even an interactive interface for the
              person who is receiving the exported data. Allowing the user to filter
              which types of data they want to export or to set some as private would help
              them feel more in control of sharing personal information.</p> </li>
              <h3>Tone of Voice</h3>
              <li><p>Working out the language for notification messages and goal
                tracking is essential for recognizing the humanity of my users.
                Guilt was a major barrier to self-care that came up repeatedly in my interviews.
                The language should feel non-judgmental and encouraging without feeling
                overly enthusiastic or insincere. If there is one thing I wish I had focused on more closely, it was this.</p></li>
              <h3>Tracking Medications</h3>
              <li><p>Medications are a type of hybrid data that deserve a slightly
                more nuanced tracking feature. They are both a yes/no data point and a ranged data point. </p></li>
              <h3>Setting Goals</h3>
              <li><p>My users wanted to be able to set and track goals or target ranges
                for behaviors. More nuanced goal tracking would go hand in
                hand with the tone of voice and also make the data visualizations more complex.</p></li>
