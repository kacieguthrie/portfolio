              <p>Website redesign, narrative development, and event display
                materials for a growing non-profit woodworking school.</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Woodworking School started out very much as a bootstrap operation
          with borrowed tools, a makeshift space, and volunteer labor. Over the years
          as the school grew considerably, it was time to rethink the content, branding,
          and structure of the online and printed materials. I worked with instructors,
          staff, and board members to more accurately communicate the school’s values and
          address the student’s needs.</p>

          <h2>Learning about the students</h2>
          <p>I had a lot of opportunities to talk to prospective students,

            <h3>Talking to Visitors</h3>
            <p>Because the school was at a state park, a lot of foot traffic came through to
              see the school. Talking to visitors and potential students helped us pinpoint common
              questions and initial impressions. </p>

            <h3>2-hour Feedback Sessions</h3>
            <p>Feedback sessions at the end of our 12-week classes was invaluable for understanding
              what students were taking away from their experience vs. their expectations going into the
              course. Using their concepts and emotional reactions helped us write copy that reflected their
              experience and develop an authentic narrative.  </p>
