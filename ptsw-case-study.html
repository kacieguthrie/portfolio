                materials for a growing non-profit woodworking school.</p>

      <section>
        <div class="container-sm">
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>The Woodworking School started out very much as a bootstrap operation
            with borrowed tools, a makeshift space, and volunteer labor. Over the years
            as the school grew considerably, it was time to rethink the content, branding,
            and structure of the online and printed materials. I worked with instructors,
            staff, and board members to more accurately communicate the school’s values and
            address the student’s needs.</p>
          <p>Working with a mission-based organization meant that the community we served needed
            to be at the core of everything we did. Understanding who our students were and what
            they were getting from their experience informed almost everything we developed for these
            projects. More so than pushing our branding to reflect romanticized visions of old-timey
            woodworking, we wanted to reflect the personal growth that many of our students felt from
            their time at the school. </p>

              <h3>Talking to Visitors</h3>
              <p>Because the school was at a state park, a significant amount of foot traffic came through to
                see the school. Talking to visitors and potential students helped us pinpoint common
                questions and initial impressions. </p>

              <p>Feedback sessions at the end of our 12-week classes was invaluable for understanding
                what students were taking away from their experience vs. their expectations going into the
                course. Using their concepts and emotional reactions helped us write copy that reflected their
                experience and develop an authentic narrative.  </p>

        <div class="container-sm">
        <h2>Restructuring the Information Architecture (IA)</h2>
        <p>Since the school had grown from offering about 20 classes/year to around 55, I wanted to restructure
          the course offerings from a spreadsheet format into a catalog format. This was divided by category
          and searchable by level, course-length/cost, and instructor. There was still a high demand for a calendar
          format, so we included a chronological version as well.</p>

          <div class="comment-card sw">
            <h3>Browsing</h3>
            <p>I added short descriptions and images so students could browse offerings more easily. Links to the full
              class descriptions gave very detailed (and long) descriptions of curriculum and important information that
              were previously overwhelming to users.</p>

            <h3>Instructor Pages</h3>
            <p>For students who were searching for classes by instructor, I was
              able to list class offering links on instructorpages and syndicate
              those links so they only needed to be updated in one place. This both
              simplified the user flow for students and improved site consistiency.</p>

        <h2>Visual Design</h2>
        <h3>Logo</h3>
        <p>A logo redesign wasn’t in the budget, so instead we shifted to using
          the existing letterhead more frequently instead of the logo, which was somewhat outdated.</p>
        <h3>Colors and Type</h3>
        <p>I shifted the colors from green and khaki to blue-gray, ochre-yellow,
          and rusty red. I chose Palatino Linotype as our main typeface to convey
          a more traditional feel, but mixed in Oswald to give it a touch of modernity.</p>
        <h2>Platform</h2>
        <p>The platform we chose needed to be able to be maintained with volunteer
          or non-expert resources, so free tech support and an automatically responsive site were crucial.</p>

        <p>I chose Squarespace for the school because it would be sustainable for a
          low budget through potentially lean years and the office staff felt
          less intimidated by Squarespace than Wordpress.</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
