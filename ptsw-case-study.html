          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>The Port Townsend School of Woodworking started out as a bootstrap operation
            with borrowed tools, a makeshift space, and volunteer labor. Over the years
            as the school grew considerably, it was time to rethink the content, branding,
            and structure of the online and printed materials. I worked with instructors,
            staff, and board members to more accurately communicate the school’s values and
            address the student’s needs.</p>

          <h2>Learning about the students</h2>
          <p>There were abundant opportunities to talk to prospective students,

              <p>Because the school was at a state park, a significant amount of foot traffic came through to
                see the school. Talking to visitors and potential students helped us pinpoint <strong>common
                questions and initial impressions</strong>. </p>

                course. Using their concepts and emotional reactions helped us write copy that reflected their

          <h2>Restructuring the Information Architecture (IA)</h2>
          <p>Since the school had grown from offering about 20 classes/year to around 55, I wanted to restructure
            the course offerings from a spreadsheet format into a catalog format. This was divided by category
            and searchable by level, course-length/cost, and instructor. There was still a high demand for a calendar
            format, so we included a chronological version as well. I sketched out versions of the page structures on a whiteboard.</p>

            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>At this point, I was thinking more in terms of sitemaps than user flows, but my basic goal was to make most
              information no more than two or three clicks away while keeping in mind the student profiles we developed.</p>

          <div class="comment-card se">
            <h3>Browsing</h3>
            <p>I added short descriptions and images to class listings so students could browse offerings more easily. Links to the full
              class pages gave very detailed (and long) descriptions of curriculum and important information that
              were previously overwhelming to users.</p>

            <h3>Instructor Pages</h3>
            <p>For students who were searching for classes by instructor, I created instructor bio
              pages with links to their classes and syndicated
              those links so they only needed to be updated in one place. This both
              simplified the user flow for students and improved site consistency.</p>

            <p>Students attending longer programs needed access to a lot of detailed information. I added section
              sub-menus and clearer headings to longer pages so it was easier to understand the overall structure
              of the page and jump to the information. </p>

          <h2>Platform</h2>

        <div class="container-sm">
          <p>Between Wordpress and Squarespace, I chose Squarespace for the school because it would be sustainable for a
            low budget through potentially lean years and the office staff felt
            less intimidated by the backend interface.</p>

          <h2>Centering the Message</h2>
            <p> Understanding who our students were and what
              they were getting from their experience informed the message we wanted to communicate through these
              projects.</p>
            <p>More so than pushing our message to reflect romanticized visions of old-timey
            woodworking, we wanted to reflect the personal growth that many of our students felt from
            their time at the school. </p>
            <p>27.6% of students reported their gender as female or non-binary. Equal representation in imagery was the main tool we used to build a message of inclusivity.</p>
            <p>We identified four sub-concepts that aligned with the school's values and the student experience
              and expanded on the language we used to describe the school's philosophy.</p>

          <h2>Website Homepage</h2>
          <p>The homepage went through a series of iterations. Featuring upcoming
            classes on the homepage was wholly ineffective as was listing specific instructors. </p>
          <p>Over time, I shifted the content to emphasize what makes the school distinct and reflect the mission.</p>

          <p>Ultimately I simplified the homepage to include a welcome video, a newsletter
            signup, a space to feature a link to any events or news that had been
            recently promoted through marketing, and recent blog posts. </p>

          <p>A significant amount of students came to the school after finding it at an event.
          We wanted to update the presentation materials to support those interactions with visuals. </p>
          <p>This was the easiest part because so much of the groundwork had already been
              done with the website and narrative. </p>
          <p>Practical considerations were that any display needed to be collapsible, lightweight, easy to transport, and
            weatherproof. It was important that the materials didn’t feel too corporate or plasticy. </p>

          <p>We decided to make hanging banners with turned wooden dowel supports to give them a handmade touch. This also
            allowed for flexible configurations depending on unpredictable space and positioning requirements at event venues.</p>

          <h3>Developing a Process</h3>
          <p>Since I've gained more formal training in web design and user experience after this project, it's interesting to look back
            and think about which strategies for design I accidentally stumbled upon and which parts I struggled with. Thinking about some
            version of personas, IA, typography/colors, and wireframe sketches
            came out naturally through the work. User testing, however, would have benefited this project immensely. Though I generally got positive
            feedback from students about the site, I wasn't pinpointing specific problems. When some part of the site's content or
            structure didn't seem to be effective, I often had no good guesses as to why.</p>

          <h3>Accommodating Content</h3>
          <p>I made a lot of accommodations on this site for existing content that was 'grandfathered' into the redesign. In retrospect,
          the message would be stronger and the information would be clearer with less content. I would advocate for cutting a lot of the
          existing material, and make the case to stakeholders as to why less is often more.</p>

          <h3>Pushing the Limits of the Platform</h3>
          <p>Some of the challenges I faced by choosing Squarespace as a platform that didn't seem overly limiting when the project started tended to
           mushroom as the site grew. I had to jerry-rig a few imperfect workarounds to achieve the structure I was going for.
           Figuring out those workarounds was actually a lot of fun, and I still think it was a good choice for this organization in terms of being
           accessible and user-friendly. Paring down the site content would help make it more compatible with the platform. </p>

          <h3>Passing the Baton</h3>
          <p>Since passing off this project, there has been some issues with layout consistiency and typography choices. I'm currently helping the school
            develop a style guide for maintaining visual consistiency across new pages and guidelines for homepage strategies. </p>
