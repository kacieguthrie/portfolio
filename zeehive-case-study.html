          <h3>What I learned</h3>
          <p>This project got me thinking about how we organize things. The people in my house were leaving coats and bags all over the living room even though there was a closet with hangers right by the door. I put up a row of hooks and a few baskets just outside the closet and suddenly people were putting their things away. I hypothesized that when we organize things, they don’t have to be very accurately organized in order to find them again and that might apply to our storage, too. The closet/hanger situation was too much work and just having all the coats in generally the right place was enough to solve the problem. This project would be different if the goal was storing something like financial records that relied on precision, but because my users were mostly private or small businesses, a little bit organized would be better than not organized at all. I found myself asking, where do I need hangars and where do I need hooks? </p>
